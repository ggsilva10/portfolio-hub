## 🎯 About The Project

This is not a static portfolio. The main goal of this project is to serve as a **Public Roadmap** of my learning. The "Project Roadmap" page documents the projects I am building, my progress, and the technologies I am mastering.

The design is fully **responsive** (Mobile-First) and features a **Light/Dark Mode** toggle to ensure a great viewing experience in any lighting condition. The structure follows modern Next.js App Router best practices.
